#### Your email address:

#### Why are you the right person to talk about the topic you chose?
_Tell your audience in first person about anything relevant about you, whether it’s your background, education, experience, current or former employer, hobbies or opensource software you maintain.
Try keeping it between between 50 and 90 words.
You can of course include anything fun or quirky about yourself._

I am a developer with a passion for problem-solving, puzzles and guitar. I am a self-starter, who tried to complete formal education after years in a field. I have been working for corporates, small companies and startups. I still remember being completely fresh in the field. I was grateful for any guidance or advice, so I am trying to pay back by mentoring others. I currently live in London and work for https://snyk.io, company which provides Security as a Service.

#### Got a video?
_If you already have a recording of you giving a talk, you can paste the link here._

#### Your photo (not an illustration nor avatar):
_It will be published on the website.
Ideal photo is: a head shot, shows only you, has no “filters” applied and is as large and uncompressed as possible.
We might crop it and change contrast, brightness etc. to fit PyCon CZ visual style._

TBD

#### What is the title of your talk?
_This will be published everywhere! Make up some catchy title which will attract the audience._

Security of your application is just a few clicks away

#### Tell the audience about your talk in 1–3 paragraphs (90–200 words):
_Introduce the problem your talk will bring a solution to. Then explain why it’s a problem worth solving and use the last paragraph to tell your audience what is your approach to solving it._

Every time you type `pip install -r requirements.txt`, you are putting your web application and user data at risk. Modern web applications are using dozens of 3rd party components, that are totally out of your control. You've already learned you should test your code, but I'll do my best to convince you that you should test external code for the security vulnerabilities too.

In January, two biggest vulnerabilities, Meltdown and Spectre, were publicly disclosed (you might remember whole internet restarting few days after). Those are the most known ones, but smaller vulnerabilities are published nearly every day. And all of them can be exploited and used to abuse your application. Attacker might try take your application out, steal your users data or take advantage of your compute power.

Since vulnerabilities are disclosed, they can be also mitigated. There are multiple vendors dealing with security testing and I'll focus on the solutions for pypi package scans. During the talk, I'll show you how a vulnerability can be exploited, where and how it is reported (you'll learn what the CVE is) and how you can secure your application using `GitHub's security alerts for vulnerable dependencies` and `Snyk.io` on various levels (repository integration, CI server, CLI integration).


#### Language:
_English is preferred, but if you feel uncomfortable with it, you can give your talk in Czech or Slovak_

English

#### Difficulty:

Beginner

#### I need financial aid to make this talk possible:
_Covering travel or accommodation costs etc. Please specify this here and now, otherwise we might not be able to grant you the aid.
Details about required financial aid:
Please state explicitly:
1) why you need it,
2) what for and
3) how much in EUR or CZK.
If you require aid for more items (accommodation, travel costs etc.) please state the amount for each item._

Since I'll come from London to do a talk, it would be nice to have flight tickets covered. I am absolutely fine with low cost airlines, so my expectation would be around 1500CZK (I can provide the exact amount once I'd know the cfp result). I do not need anything else (accommodation, transport) and if the budget would be tight, I can handle it on my own.

#### Anything else you want to tell us?

Always look on the bright side of life!
